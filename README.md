# NaturalMaps
A Portfolio project by Pasquale Zito, Adam Hughes and Justin Zarb as part of Data Science Retreat.

NaturalMaps is an attempt to explore maps with natural language, such as “Find all the quietest coffee shops in Berlin that open before 8 AM and are in close proximity to a library.” At the moment, this is readily accessible open data, but going beyond simple queries requires expert know-how. We are exploring ways to make this information and analysis more accessible to the user.

## Objectives
- Use natural language processing to make map queries more accessible to non-specialists.
- Overlay other datasets such as air pollution, noise, shade, etc. to benefit individuals as well as planners.
